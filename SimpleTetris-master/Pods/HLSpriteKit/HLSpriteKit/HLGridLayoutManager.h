/**
 Set the positions of all passed nodes according to the layout-affecting parameters.

 For layout to have an effect: Either `columnCount` or `rowCount` must have been set
 non-zero.  Grid layout is limited either by the number of columns or the number of rows;
 the limiting dimension is determined by whichever property was most recently set.

 The order of the passed nodes determines position in the grid, according to the
 `fillMode` of the grid.  A square is skipped if the corresponding element in the array is
 not a kind of `SKNode` class.  (It is suggested to pass `[NSNull null]` to intentionally
 leave squares empty.)

 This method must always be called explicitly to realize layout changes.  On one hand,
 it's annoying to have to remember to call it; on the other hand, it allows the owner
 efficiently to make multiple changes (e.g. remove a node, insert another node, change the
 `squareSeparator`, etc) and re-layout only exactly once.

/**
 Sets the positions of the passed nodes according to the layout-affecting parameters.

 Compare `layout:`.  The important difference is that this method takes a 2-dimensional
 array of nodes rather than a 1-dimensional array of nodes.  The nodes are filled into the
 grid according to the `fillMode` of the grid, such that each subarray is expected to
 match with a corresponding row or column.  For example:

 - If the `fillMode` is `HLGridLayoutManagerFillRightThenDown`, the first subarray of
   nodes will be used to fill in the uppermost row, left-to-right.

 - If the `fillMode` is `HLGridLayoutManagerFillUpThenLeft`, the first subarray of
   nodes will be used to fill in the rightmost column, bottom-to-top.

 Also, when using this kind of layout, `columnCount` and `rowCount` do not limit the
 number of nodes laid out.  Instead, after layout, they can be read to determine the
 (maximum) number of rows or columns.

 As in `layout:`, a square is skipped if the corresponding element in the array is not a
 kind of `SKNode` class.  (It is suggested to pass `[NSNull null]` to intentionally leave
 squares empty.)
